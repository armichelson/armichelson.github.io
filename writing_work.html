      <h2>Home: A Definition Poem</h2>
        <p>Home (noun) 1. A house, apartment, or other shelter: As in a place where one feels “at home,” safe, comforted, and protected; Her home was Georgia; the state known for its peaches and southern hospitality; the state where people coped with the long, hot summers by drinking tall glasses of sweet tea; people were dependable; days were predictable; She had to make a change; the world around her had gotten so small 2. The place where something is native or most common: True southerners stay in their home state; they bleed red and black; they never venture beyond the borders; they told her she wasn’t going to be happy; she didn’t listen; she was not going to let the people inside it make her decisions. 3.  A person’s native place or own country: she loved predictability; she loved to know what was around the next corner; she knew what to expect at home, but how was she going to grow? 4. Any place of residence or refuge: Some say her home is now in another country, and they may be right; her world is no longer so small, and now she is known as the girl who left the state, known as the Big Peach, behind.</p>

      <h2>Headphones: A Function Poem</h2>
        <p>One ear, two ear.</p>
        <p>With a swift movement I have entered my own sphere.</p>
        <p>Tension builds.</p>
        <p>Click and play.</p>
        <p>The bass kicks in.</p>
        <p>The beat drops and I am home.</p>
        <p>Each chime and ring awakens a new nerve.</p>
        <p>I hold onto each word seeking an escape.</p>
        <p>Unwanted outside voices are silenced.</p>
        <p>The daily sprint of life is slowed.</p>
        <p>Thoughts about life’s uncertainties and doubts evaporate.</p>
        <p>No longer is this moment about the dos and don’ts.</p>
        <p>The are you making good choices and what is your next move.</p>
        <p>No, now it’s about me. It’s about the now.</p>
        <p>I feel invincible, untouchable as the chimes begin to fade.</p>
        <p>The outside slowly creeps back in.</p>
        <p>The voices invade.</p>
        <p>The tension disappears.</p>
        <p>In one swift moment I have left my own sphere.</p>
        <p>I re-enter my reality.</p>

      <h2>Questions: A Replacement Poem</h2>
        <p>They told the children who live the meaning of life to say
        what is laughter.</p>
        <p>And they saw the sky that demands the noise of
        thousands of children.</p>
        <p>I bowed my head and stretched my arms as though
        I was trying to play with them.</p>
        <p>And then one Friday night they wandered by
        the abandoned house.</p>
        <p>And they encountered another child by the river with
        her sister and brother</p>
        <p>and a baby doll and a letter.</p>
